# shortfuts

`shortfuts` is a simple Chrome extension that exposes keyboard shortcuts for common actions in the FUT website, primarily centered around my own BPM needs.

## Currently supported shortcuts
* **\\** - Executes "Buy Now" on the current item (on "Search Results" page).
* **b** - Buys a regular bronze pack (400 tokens).
* **backspace** - Quickly go from the "Search Results" page back to the "Unassigned" page.
* **c** - Gets search results for other listings of the current item so you can compare prices.
* **m** - Lists the selected item for min BIN (200 tokens).
* **q** - Quick sells the current item.
* **s** - Stores the current item into your club.
* **t** - Places the current item on your transfer list.
* **up/down arrow keys** - This allows you to traverse the items in your pack with the keyboard.
* **w** - Toggles the current item's status on the "Transfer Targets" list (i.e. adds if it's not on there already, or removes if it is).
